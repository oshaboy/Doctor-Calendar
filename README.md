# Doctor Calendar - 

This is a calendar for Doctors. I made this after my grandpa (who is a medical doctor). Couldn't find a Calendar with 15 minute intervals besides the expensive, proprietary, Microsoft Outlook. It requires a jre 9.0 or jre 1.8 instalation to run. 

v1.1-removed annoying "no file made for today" pop up, and made the software save on close, added jre 1.8 support.
